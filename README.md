DroidPal Live Wallpaper
========

After deciding to learn app development, this is the first app I started making.
It was never fully finished and released, though it is very close to completion.

The idea was to make an interactive live wallpaper that involves the Android mascot, was easy on resource usage (most live wallpapers drain a lot of battery), a little quirky and fun.
